# Haskell Head Function Error on Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell when using the `head` function on an empty list. The code in `bug.hs` attempts to get the head of an empty list, resulting in a runtime exception. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.hs`, demonstrates how to handle this scenario gracefully using pattern matching or the `maybe` function.
